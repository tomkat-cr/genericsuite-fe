Welcome to GenericSuite, a comprehensive software solution designed to enhance your productivity and streamline your workflows. This repository contains the frontend part of GenericSuite, equipped with a customizable CRUD editor, login interface and a suite of tools to kickstart your development process.

## Features

- **Customizable CRUD editor:** core CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) code that can be parametrized and extended by JSON configuration files. There's no need to rewrite code for each table editor.
- **Customizable menu:** menu and endpoints can be parametrized and extended by JSON configuration files in the backend side. The API will supply the menu estructure and security check based on the user's security group, and GenericSuite will draw the menu and available options.
- **Customizable Login Interface:** Easily adapt the login page to match your brand identity with the App logo.
- **Development and Production Scripts:** Quick commands to start development or build your application for QA, staging production environments on AWS.
- **Testing with Jest:** Comes pre-configured with Jest for running tests, including an initial test for the `<App />` component.
- **Inclusion of Essential Files:** `.env.example` for environment variables setup, `Makefile` to short-cut frequent operations, `webpack.config.js` and `config-overrides.js` to run the App locally with `Webpack` or `react-app-rewired`, `scripts` with development and production scripts, 
 and `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking changes across versions.

The perfect companion for this frontend solution is the [backend version of The GenericSuite](https://github.com/tomkat-cr/genericsuite-be).
